// rather than to a stream. If n is zero, nothing is written, 
// and s may be a null pointer. Otherwise, output characters beyond 
// the n-1st are discarded rather than being written to the array, 
// and a null character is written at the end of the characters 
// actually written into the array. If copying takes place between
// objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
